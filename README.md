# ILK Theme
This theme has been created specifically for C and the tools surrounding it like Markdown and Make.
There are some minor bugs which are a result of poor VSCode semantic analysis of C (hence they are
present in all other themes), but for the most part it works as expected and is very readable.

## How to Install
Move the whole folder to ```.../vscode/resources/app/extensions/``` **OR** install the extension
from the marketplace.
